# Pursuit-Core-iOS-ImagePicker-Lab

Build an app that has a profile view.  The profile view should have:

- An Image View that displays the user's picture
- The ability to change the image with a new picture using `UIImagePickerController`
- A text label that displays the user's name
- Any other properties that you want to add

You can use any method you want for the UI of editing the photo.  Make sure to consider what the Image View looks like before the user has uploaded an image.

Some profile view examples:
